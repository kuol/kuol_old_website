      <description>In recent years, there are a lot of heated debates on whether H-1B visa program is good or bad for America. Considering this visa program only grants 85,000 foreign employees each year and the total employed in the US is 146,624,000 in 2017, it is interesting to see how the 0.058% workforce has generated such strong responses from both sides.
While news such as Disney forced 250 its IT employees to train up their foreign replacement before their layoff or how a former Microsoft employee denied H-1B went home and started a $7 billion company probably cannot tell the whole story, unsensational data may tell us more.</description>
