H-1B visa is  a temporary visa that employers use to hire foreigners in “specialty occupations” for which there are not enough skilled American workers to fill available jobs. The workers must have at least a bachelor’s degree. It enables those employed to legally work in the United States for three years, with the possibility of extensions.

In recent years, there are a lot of heated debates on whether H-1B visa program is good or bad for America. Considering this visa program only grants 85,000 foreign employees each year and the total employed in the US is 146,624,000 in 2017, it is interesting to see how the 0.058% workforce has generated such strong responses from both sides. 

While news such as [Disney forced 250 its IT employees to train up their foreign replacement before their layoff](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/last-task-after-layoff-at-disney-train-foreign-replacements.html) or [how a former Microsoft employee denied H-1B went home and started a $7 billion company](https://money.cnn.com/2017/02/02/news/india/snapdeal-india-kunal-bahl-h1b-visa/index.html) probably cannot tell the whole story, unsensational data may tell us more.

## H-1B General Trend

The number of H-1B applicants has been increasing since 2010, after the Great Recession. But, this trend has stopped in 2017. This is quite interesting, since the economy has been doing great and the total employed number in the United States has been increasing. See the following two plots. Does it have anything to do the current political atmosphere? One can only guess :-)

## Who Are the Biggest H-1B Sponsors?

You may guess that companies who filed the most H-1B applications are big tech companies. After all, this visa is intended to hire foreign "specialty" workers when not enough skilled Americans workers can be found. Although tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon are indeed among the biggest sponsors, You may be shocked to find out US companies only file about 30% of applications among the Top 15 biggest sponsors.The following table details the Top 15 biggest H-1B sponsors in 2017. The pie chart shows a breakdown of country of headquarters for the top 15.


H-1B Sponsor Name | Number of Application | Headquarter
------------- |-------------:|--------------
INFOSYS LIMITED | 20587 | India
TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES LIMITED | 13529 | India
CAPGEMINI AMERICA INC | 9604 | France
IBM INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED | 8734 | India
TECH MAHINDRA (AMERICAS),INC. | 7543 | India
DELOITTE CONSULTING LLP | 7179 | US
ACCENTURE LLP | 6690 | Ireland
ERNST & YOUNG U.S. LLP | 6096 | US
WIPRO LIMITED | 5177 | India
GOOGLE INC. | 5074 | US
MICROSOFT CORPORATION | 5005 | US
HCL AMERICA, INC. | 4263 | India
SYNTEL CONSULTING INC. | 4187 | US
AMAZON CORPORATE LLC | 4165 | US
COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS U.S. CORPORATION | 2707 | US

If you have read about opinions on how companies like Infosys, Tata Consultancy may be abusing the H-1B visa system and have caused may Americans to lose their jobs, the fact that they are top on the list may not be surprising. However, there are also France based outsourcing company _Capgemini_ (No. 3), Ireland based _Accenture_, even US based _Syntel_ (No. 13).  

In fact, it is probably more interesting to see that only Google, Miscrosoft and Amazon are product companies while the rest of the top 15 are consulting companies.
