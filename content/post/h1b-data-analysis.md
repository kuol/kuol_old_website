In recent years, there are a lot of heated debates on whether H-1B visa program is good or bad for America. Considering this visa program only grants 85,000 foreign employees each year and the total employed in the US is 146,624,000 in 2017, it is interesting to see how the 0.058% workforce has generated such strong responses from both sides. 

While news such as [Disney forced 250 its IT employees to train up their foreign replacement before their layoff](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/last-task-after-layoff-at-disney-train-foreign-replacements.html) or [how a former Microsoft employee denied H-1B went home and started a $7 billion company](https://money.cnn.com/2017/02/02/news/india/snapdeal-india-kunal-bahl-h1b-visa/index.html) probably cannot tell the whole story, unsensational data may tell us more.

## H-1B General Trend

The number of H-1B applicants has been increasing since 2010, after the Great Recession, except in 2017. This is quite interesting, since the economy has been doing great and the total employed number in the United States has been increasing. See the following two plots. Does it have anything to do the current political atmosphere? One can only guess :-)
